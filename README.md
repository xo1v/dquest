# dquest
Command line tool and "macro" for macOS that automates aamiaa's Discord Quest autocomplete process/script via AppleScript.

# Instructions
1 - Clone this repository \
2 - ```cd``` into it (typically ```cd ~/dquest```) \
3 - Run ```setup.sh``` (```sh setup.sh```)

# What dquest will do:
- Open Safari (if not opened yet, which is not recommended btw)
- Open Web Discord
- Open the console
- Paste in aamiaa's script \
\
If you don't have features for web developers enabled in Safari, you can run ```dquest enabledev```, though it is recommended
to enable them manually, as the command is buggy (which doesn't mean your computer will explode if you run it)
